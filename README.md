Implemented using Matlab R2017. Welcome to rewrite to Python, etc.

FRNNI - fuzzy rough nearest neighbor imputation
OWANNI - ordered weighted average based fuzzy rough nearest neighbor imputation

The implementation is totally based on personal understanding of the algorithms proposed by the two authors, I have validated the algorithms performance and it met the requirement. The authors did not open access the code. Therefore, I believe I am the only one implement their methods and make it open. However, it is not the best nearest neighbor imputation methods. You may refer my implementation to upgrade the algorithms.
